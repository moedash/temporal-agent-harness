# ABOUTME: One mounted stream's cursor for the merge, a thin peek-ahead wrapper over a single
# agent workflow's turn-event subscription. Holds at most one peeked ``head`` event, runs at most
# one in-flight ``pull`` task, and applies the root-only "skip to my turn_started" preamble that
# establishes the quiescent start point. The engine (merge.py) owns scheduling across cursors;
# this type owns only one stream's read position.
